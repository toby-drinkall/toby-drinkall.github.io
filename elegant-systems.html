      <h2>Systems I Find Elegant: 0–1 → 1–N Thinking</h2>

      <p>
        Increasingly, the systems I find the most elegant are the ones where a small number of parts or principles
        provide disproportionate value. That is why I prefer the two-stroke engine to the four-stroke: same power,
        half the displacement, easier to maintain. When solving problems, I like to first consider if there is a
        two-stroke solution.
      </p>

      <p>
        Similarly, the most impactful tools for end-users need not be complex. A good example of this is in
        cryptography, an area of research that is notoriously complex and often intentionally obtuse. And yet, the
        One-time Pad (1917), which encrypts messages using nothing more than a random number generator and
        simple addition, remains the only provably unbreakable code when used correctly. By contrast, later
        systems like the Enigma machine in WWII were mechanically intricate, with multiple rotors and
        plugboards, but that complexity hid structural weaknesses that were eventually exploited.

      <p>
        My point is that I think elegance and complexity are too often conflated. While the one-time pad system
        may not have been a product fit for large-scale military use, this earlier innovation reminds me to focus
        on finding the most direct sequence of actions that solves an end-user’s problem. What wins? What
        works? Focus on nothing else.
      </p>

      <p>
        Market domination of a product, however, does not allow for an engineering mindset that focuses solely
        on short-term wins. We want to solve customer problems, but in a way that compounds the value of the
        service. How I conceptualize this is through what we might call the “nth User Value Engine” – 1-&gt;N rather
        than 0-&gt;1.
      </p>

      <!-- FIGURE 4: 1-to-N compounding loop diagram -->
      <figure class="essay-figure">

          src="1-n.png"
          alt="Flow diagram showing how user actions add value for future users in a compounding loop."
          class="essay-image"
        >
        <figcaption>Fig. 4 – A compounding value loop: each user leaves the product better for the next.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        Practically, it’s a system where builders focus not only on providing value but capturing it. This is done by
        building features that leave the next user better off because of what the last user did. As more customers
        are on board, they add their own structured data, feedback, and edge cases, which makes the engine more
        valuable, compounded further by network effects. Over time, you don’t just have a list of logos; you have
        an engine that makes every new deployment make the whole solution line smarter, stickier, and easier to
        sell.
      </p>

      <p>
        I don’t find this system as elegant as the two-stroke, but I do find it useful.
