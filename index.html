      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        I’m a research scientist interested in machine learning, interpretability, and the ethics of AI in high-stakes systems.
        I’m currently completing my MSc at the University of Oxford, where my thesis explores strategic creativity in military
        decision-support systems and the alignment of autonomous systems with human ethical values.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alongside my thesis, I work as a Research Assistant at the Oxford Internet Institute and the Alan Turing Institute
        under Professor Mariarosaria Taddeo. My research contributes to the <em>Ethics of AI in Defence</em> project.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also serve as a Senior Fellow and Team Lead in the Next Frontier Seminar — a transatlantic fellowship funded by Eric Schmidt —
        where I lead Oxford’s team in developing the first benchmarks for evaluating LLMs’ adherence to International Humanitarian Law.
        This work sits at the intersection of frontier AI, interpretability, and responsible deployment.
